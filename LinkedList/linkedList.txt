~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Linked List~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linked List:It is a linear data structure use to organise the collection of elements, store elements in separate 
            memory locations, and each element points to the next one in the sequence.

    Structure of a Linked List: It contain the "data" and "next" pointer that has location of next node
                                The complete package of data and next is known as node of Linked List;

Linked Lists are mainly three types 
    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
    * Circular Linked List

    # Singly Linked List: 
        Each node points to the next node in the sequence and last node points to null(indicate end of list).

    # Doubly Linked List: 
        Each node has two pointers(one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node).
        it allows traversal in both direction;

    # Circular Linked List:
        * using singly linked list: The last node's next pointer points to the first node, forming a loop.
        * using Doubly linked list: The first node points to the last node, and the last node points back to the first node.
    
Operations on Linked List
    * Insertion
    * Deletion
    * Traversal
    * Searching
    * Reversal
