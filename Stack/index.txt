~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Stack ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

stack: 
      * It is lenear data structure which follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
        # L - Last
        # I - In
        # F - First
        # O - Out
      * "LIFO" This means the last element inserted into the stack is the first one removed. Like a stack of plates, you can only add or remove plates from the top.
      * Abstract Data Type (ADT): A stack is often implemented using other data structures like arrays or linked lists.
      * Single Access Point: Insertions and deletions occur only at the "top" of the stack.


  * Operations:
      Push(): add data into stack.
      Pop(): delete data from stack.
      getTop(): return the top element.
    
  Overflow: Occurs when trying to push an element onto a full stack.
  Underflow: Occurs when trying to pop an element from an empty stack.
