~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Data Structure~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Structure is mainly two types 
    * Linear Data Structure
    * Non-Linear Data Structure


    # Linear Data Structure
        In this type, elememts are stored in a sequential order and each elements are connected with its privious
        and next element which make it easy to traverse or access the elements in a linear fashion;
        Relationship between the elements is strictly one-to-one.


    Type of Linear Data Structure
        * Arrays
        * Linked List
        * Stack
        * Queue


    # Non-Linear Data Structure
        Here, elements are not stored in a sequential order, they arranged in hierarchical or interconnected manner
        relationship between elements is many-to-one or one-to-many;


    Type of Non-Linear Data Structure
    * Tree
    * Graph
